METEOROLOGICAL TERMINOLOGY

Standard
Temperature
Outside Air Temperature is the free air static
temperature. It may be expressed in either degrees
Celsius or degrees Fahrenheit.
Standard Temperature is 15°C at sea level
pressure altitude and decreases by 2°C for each
1000 feet of altitude.
Pressure Pressure Altitude is the altitude read from an
Altitude altimeter when the altimeter's barometric scale has
been set to 29.92 inches of mercury (1013 mb).

Brake Horsepower is the power developed by the
engine.
Revolutions Per Minute is engine speed.
Static RPM is engine speed attained during a full
throttle engine runup when the airplane is on the
ground and stationary.
Manifold Absolute Pressure is the absolute
pressure measured in the engine induction system.
MAP is measured in units of inches of mercury
(in HG).
Decreased proportion of fuel in the fuel-air mixture
supplied to the engine. As air density decreases,
the amount of fuel required by the engine decreases
for a given throttle setting. Adjusting the fuel-air
mixture to provide a smaller portion of fuel is known
as "leaning" the mixture.
Increased proportion of fuel in the fuel-air mixture
supplied to the engine. As air density increases, the
amount of fuel required by the engine increases for
a given throttle setting. Adjusting the fuel-air mixture
to provide a greater portion of fuel is known as
"richening" the mixture.
Mixture control full forward (pushed in, full control
travel, toward the panel).
Mixture control full aft (pulled out, full control travel,
away from the panel).

Demonstrated Crosswind Velocity is the velocity
of the crosswind component for which adequate
control of the airplane during takeoff and landing
was actually demonstrated during certification tests.
The value shown is not considered to be limiting.
Usable Fuel is the fuel available for flight planning.
Unusable Fuel is the quantity of fuel that can not be
safely used in flight.
Gallons Per Hour is the amount of fuel consumed
per hour.
Nautical Miles Per Gallon is the distance which can
be expected per gallon of fuel consumed at a
specific engine power setting and/or flight
configuration.
g is acceleration due to gravity.
Course Datum is the compass reference used by
the autopilot, along with course deviation, to provide
lateral control when tracking a navigation signal.

Reference Datum is an imaginary vertical plane from
which all horizontal distances are measured for
balance purposes.
Station is a location along the airplane fuselage given
in terms of the distance from the reference datum.
Arm is the horizontal distance from the reference
datum to the center of gravity (C.G.) of an item.
Moment is the product of the weight of an item
multiplied by its arm. (Moment divided by the constant
1000 is used in this handbook to simplify balance
calculations by reducing the number of digits.)
Center of Gravity is the point at which an airplane, or
equipment, would balance if suspended. Its distance
from the reference datum is found by dividing the
total moment by the total weight of the airplane.
Center of Gravity Arm is the arm obtained by
adding the airplane's individual moments and dividing
the sum by the total weight.
Center of Gravity Limits are the extreme center of
gravity locations within which the airplane must be
operated at a given weight.
Standard Empty Weight is the weight of a standard
airplane, including unusable fuel, full operating fluids
and full engine oil.
Basic Empty Weight is the standard empty weight
plus the weight of optional equipment.
Useful Load is the difference between ramp weight
and the basic empty weight.
MAC {Mean Aerodynamic Chord) is the chord of an
imaginary rectangular airfoil having the same pitching
moments throughout the flight range as that of the
actual wing.

Maximum Ramp Weight is the maximum weight
approved for ground maneuver, and includes the

Maximum Takeoff Weight is the maximum weight
approved for the start of the takeoff roll.
Maximum Landing Weight is the maximum weight
approved for the landing touchdown.
Tare is the weight of chocks, blocks, stands, etc.
used when weighing an airplane, and is included in
the scale readings. Tare is deducted from the scale
reading to obtain the actual (net
